# 1-D Model for Counterflow Heat Exchangers

This project contains one-dimensional models for design and analysis of counterflow heat exchangers which accounts for both heat transfer and fluid dynamic performance. Heat transfer and friction factor correlations for straight channels, zigzag channels, discontinuous S-shaped fins, and NACA 0020 airfoil fins are included in the code. These models are being used to inform the design of a high-temperature recuperator for a supercritial CO2 closed Brayton cycle, particularly focused towards concentrating solar power applications.
